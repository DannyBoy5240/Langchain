# Agents

Agents are systems that use a language model to interact with other tools.
These can be used to do more grounded question/answering, interact with APIs, or even take actions.
These agents can be used to power the next generation of personal assistants - 
systems that intelligently understand what you mean, and then can take actions to help you accomplish your goal.

Agents are a core use of LangChain - so much so that there is a whole module dedicated to them.
Therefore, we recommend that you check out that documentation for detailed instruction on how to work
with them.
