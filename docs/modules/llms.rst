LLMs
==========================

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a core component of LangChain.
LangChain is not a provider of LLMs, but rather provides a standard interface through which
you can interact with a variety of LLMs.

The following sections of documentation are provided:

- `Getting Started <./llms/getting_started.html>`_: An overview of all the functionality the LangChain LLM class provides.

- `Key Concepts <./llms/key_concepts.html>`_: A conceptual guide going over the various concepts related to LLMs.

- `How-To Guides <./llms/how_to_guides.html>`_: A collection of how-to guides. These highlight how to accomplish various objectives with our LLM class, as well as how to integrate with various LLM providers.

- `Reference <../reference/modules/llms.html>`_: API reference documentation for all LLM classes.
