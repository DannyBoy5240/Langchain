How-To Guides
=============

There are a lot of different utilities that LangChain provides integrations for
These guides go over how to use them.
These can largely be grouped into two categories:

1. `Generic Utilities <./generic_how_to.html>`_: Generic utilities, including search, python REPLs, etc.
2. `Utilities for working with Documents <./combine_docs_how_to.html>`_: Utilities aimed at making it easy to work with documents (text splitting, embeddings, vectorstores, etc).
