Prompt Templates
==========================

Language models take text as input - that text is commonly referred to as a prompt.
Typically this is not simply a hardcoded string but rather a combination of a template, some examples, and user input.
LangChain provides several classes and functions to make constructing and working with prompts easy.

The following sections of documentation are provided:

- `Getting Started <./prompts/getting_started.html>`_: An overview of all the functionality LangChain provides for working with and constructing prompts.

- `Key Concepts <./prompts/key_concepts.html>`_: A conceptual guide going over the various concepts related to prompts.

- `How-To Guides <./prompts/how_to_guides.html>`_: A collection of how-to guides. These highlight how to accomplish various objectives with our prompt class.

- `Reference <../reference/prompts.html>`_: API reference documentation for all prompt classes.
