# Tools

Tools are functions that agents can use to interact with the world.
These tools can be generic utilities (e.g. search), other chains, or even other agents.

Currently, tools can be loaded with the following snippet:

```python
from langchain.agents import load_tools
tool_names = [...]
tools = load_tools(tool_names)
```

Some tools (e.g. chains, agents) may require a base LLM to use to initialize them.
In that case, you can pass in an LLM as well:

```python
from langchain.agents import load_tools
tool_names = [...]
llm = ...
tools = load_tools(tool_names, llm=llm)
```

Below is a list of all supported tools and relevant information:

- Tool Name: The name the LLM refers to the tool by.
- Tool Description: The description of the tool that is passed to the LLM.
- Notes: Notes about the tool that are NOT passed to the LLM.
- Requires LLM: Whether this tool requires an LLM to be initialized.
- (Optional) Extra Parameters: What extra parameters are required to initialize this tool.
